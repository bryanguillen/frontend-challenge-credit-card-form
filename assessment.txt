Credit Card Form

Analysis - Problem
We need an interactive credit card form, where there is a credit card
that reflects the value of the form in real time.

Analysis - Use Cases
- User submits all correct data
- User submits form partially correct (i.e. some field(s) are missing correct values)
- User submits form totally incorrect (i.e. all fields are incorrect)

Requirements
- UI
  - Components
    - Form
      - Card Number Text Field
        - This needs to be spaced accordingly, where every four digits, a space is
          added b/w the current group and the next
      - Card Name Text Field (i.e. cc company)
      - Expiration Date Dropdowns
        - Month (2 digit format)
        - Year (4 digit format)
      - CVV Text Field
      - Submit Button
    - Credit Card
      - It will contain data/values from all of the fields mentioned above
  - Positioning of Components
    - CC overlaps form w/ a box shadow underneath the card
- UX
  - Validation
  - Interactive Card
    - Fields in card update as user fills out form (e.g. if user adds 1 for cc number, 1 gets added to cc)
  - Default State of CC Number for CC
    - #
