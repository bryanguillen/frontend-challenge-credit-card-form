Credit Card Form

Analysis - Problem
We need an interactive credit card form, where there is a credit card
that reflects the value of the form in real time.

Analysis - Use Cases
- User submits all correct data
- User submits form partially correct (i.e. some field(s) are missing correct values)
- User submits form totally incorrect (i.e. all fields are incorrect)

Requirements
- UI
  - Components
    - Form
      - Card Number Text Field
        - This needs to be spaced accordingly, where every four digits, a space is
          added b/w the current group and the next
      - Card Name Text Field (i.e. cc company)
      - Expiration Date Dropdowns
        - Month (2 digit format)
        - Year (4 digit format)
      - CVV Text Field
      - Submit Button
    - Credit Card
      - It will contain data/values from all of the fields mentioned above
  - Positioning of Components
    - CC overlaps form w/ a box shadow underneath the card
- UX
  - Validation
  - Interactive Card
    - Fields in card update as user fills out form (e.g. if user adds 1 for cc number, 1 gets added to cc)
  - Default State of CC Number for CC
    - #

Credit Card Image

Analysis - Problem
I need to overlay a credit card over the actual form.  Note, that both the front
and the back of the credit card need to be included in this.

Requirements
- Image(s) (Front and back)
  - URL(s)
  - Dimensions

Technical Design
- Image
  - URL - Front
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammederdem/credit-card-form/master/src/assets/images/5.jpeg
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammederdem/credit-card-form/master/src/assets/images/visa.png
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammederdem/credit-card-form/master/src/assets/images/chip.png
  - URL - Back
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammederdem/credit-card-form/master/src/assets/images/visa.png 
  - URL Other Asset Like Elements
    - Back
      - Magnetic Stripe
      - White Stripe (for CVV)
- Markup
  ```
  <div class="credit-card">
    <div class="credit-card-background-image-container"></div>
    <div class="credit-card-chip-container"></div>
    <div class="credit-card-logo-container"></div>
    <div class="credit-card-number-container"></div>
    <div class="credit-card-name-container"></div>
    <div class="credit-card-expiration-container"></div>
  </div>
  ```
  - Notes
    - The credit-card-content-container could the be "overlayed"
      the actual background

Next Steps
- Assess and implement the back of the card
- Assess and implement the overlaying of card on form
- Assess and implement functionalities
  - Tackle Functionalities in Small Batches
  - Functionalities
    - Flipping Behavior (when focused on CVV)
    - Mirroring Behavior
    - Clicking on CC Behavior
- Clean up UI
- Refactor Code

Additional Notes:
- Assess how to salvage projects to demonstrate learnings
  on Redux
- Assess and implement Formik alternative (?)
