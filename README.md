## Description

![CC Authorization Demo](https://github.com/bryg217/frontend-challenge-credit-card-form/blob/master/cc-authorization-form.gif)

Challenge #1 of 6 from [6 Frontend Challenges to Code](https://medium.com/better-programming/here-are-6-frontend-challenges-to-code-9952190c97cc).  It's a credit 
card authorization form without a backend, **implemented in React**.  It's purpose is to help
sharpen my skills in the following areas:

* Form handling and validation
* Handling event listeners (e.g. when the fields change, itâ€™ll print the values on the credit card)
* Understanding how to display and position elements on the page, especially the credit card overlapping 
  the form
* General Data Flow
